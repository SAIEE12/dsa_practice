# Operators
# Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
# In Python, there are several types of operators:
# Arithmetic Operators  
# 1. Addition
# 2. Subtraction
# 3. Multiplication
# 4. Division
# 5. Floor Division
# 6. Modulus
# 7. Exponentiation
a = 15
b= 5

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a/b)
print(a//b)
print(a*b)
print(a%b)
print(a**b)


print("------------------")



# Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean value (True or False).
# In Python, there are several comparison operators:
# 1. Equal to
# 2. Not equal to
# 3. Greater than
# 4. Less than
# 5. Greater than or equal to
# 6. Less than or equal to
a = 10
b = 5
print(a == b)
print(a != b)
print(a > b)    
print(a < b)
print(a >= b)
print(a <= b)
print("------------------")
x= "Sai"
y= "Sai"
print(x==y)
print(x==y)

print("------------------")

# Logical Operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They return a boolean value (True or False).
# In Python, there are three logical operators:
# 1. and
# 2. or
# 3. not


# simple calculator

a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

addition = a + b
substraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b
floor_division = a // b
modulus = a % b
exponentiation = a ** b
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Substraction:", substraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)
print("Floor Division:", floor_division)
print("Modulus:", modulus)
print("Exponentiation:", exponentiation)
print("------------------")

# Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform arithmetic operations and assign the result to the variable.
# In Python, there are several assignment operators:
# 1. Assignment
# 2. Add and assign
# 3. Subtract and assign
# 4. Multiply and assign
# 5. Divide and assign
# 6. Floor divide and assign
# 7. Modulus and assign
# 8. Exponentiate and assign
a = 10
b = 5
a += b
print(a)  # Output: 15
a -= b
print(a)  # Output: 10
a *= b
print(a)  # Output: 50
a /= b
print(a)  # Output: 10.0
a //= b
print(a)  # Output: 2.0
a %= b
print(a)  # Output: 2.0
a **= b
print(a)  # Output: 32.0
print("------------------")

# Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. They return a boolean value (True or False).
# In Python, there are two identity operators:
# 1. is
# 2. is not
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a
print(a is b)  # Output: False
print(a is c)  # Output: True
print(a is not b)  # Output: True
print(a is not c)  # Output: False
print("------------------")





# conditional statements
# Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. In Python, there are several conditional statements:
# 1. if statement
# 2. if-else statement
# 3. if-elif-else statement
# 4. nested if statement
# 6. ternary operator (conditional expression)
